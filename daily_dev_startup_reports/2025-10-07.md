```javascript
// MCP coordinates the strategy
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({ topology: "mesh" })

// Task tool executes with real agents
Task("Backend Dev", "Build API...", "backend-dev")
Task("Frontend Dev", "Create UI...", "coder")

```

**Day Classification:** üéØ **SUSTAINED MOMENTUM**

---

## üìã OUTSTANDING ISSUES

### **High Priority**
1. Exercise storage architecture (API uses JSON, not database)
2. Frontend-backend integration not tested E2E
3. SQLAlchemy circular imports (27 test errors)

### **Medium Priority**
4. 18 verbs missing from dataset
5. Frontend test suite (MSW 2.x polyfills needed)
6. Redux persist SSR warning

### **Low Priority**
7. TypeScript warnings (~60 warnings)
8. Code coverage improvement (60% ‚Üí 80%)
9. ESLint 9.x migration (documented, deferred)

---

## üí° STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **The Documentation-Execution Cycle**
**Pattern Observed:**
1. Create standards (agent instructions)
2. Execute work (database seeding, testing)
3. Enhance standards (communication, orchestration)
4. Execution quality improves

**Value:**
- Virtuous cycle of continuous improvement
- Standards guide execution
- Execution reveals standard gaps
- Iteration enhances both

---

### **Content Quality Over Quantity**
**Approach:**
- 27 exercises (pedagogically designed)
- vs. 100+ exercises (auto-generated)

**Why Quality Wins:**
- Better learning outcomes
- Professional user experience
- MVP validation requires quality, not volume
- Can scale quantity after proving value
