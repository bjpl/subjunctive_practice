## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Remove Enhanced Configuration Files

**Context**: Multiple configuration variants (standard and enhanced) were causing confusion and deployment issues.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keep both variants**: Maintain separate configs for different environments - Pros: Flexibility. Cons: High maintenance, confusion, complexity
2. **Merge into single config**: Consolidate all settings into standard configs - Pros: Simplicity, single source of truth. Cons: Loss of experimental features

**Decision**: Remove all enhanced variants and use single standard configuration

**Rationale**: Simplicity and maintainability outweigh benefits of having multiple configuration variants. Single source of truth reduces errors and deployment issues.

**Trade-offs**: Lost some experimental configuration options, but gained significant reduction in complexity and maintenance burden.

---

### Decision 2: SQLAlchemy Schema Organization

**Context**: Circular import issues between models and schemas were causing backend startup failures.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keep schemas in models directory**: Maintain current structure - Pros: Familiarity. Cons: Circular imports, tight coupling
2. **Separate schemas directory**: Move schemas to dedicated directory - Pros: Clear separation, eliminates circular imports. Cons: More directories to manage

**Decision**: Create dedicated `/backend/schemas/` directory and remove `models/schemas.py`

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns eliminates circular dependencies and follows SQLAlchemy best practices. Dedicated schemas directory improves code organization.

**Trade-offs**: Requires updating import paths across codebase, but provides better long-term maintainability and eliminates critical bugs.

## Knowledge Captured

### New Learnings
- **SQLAlchemy Best Practices**: Learned importance of clear separation between models and schemas to avoid circular imports. Schema definitions should live in dedicated directory, not mixed with ORM models.
- **Configuration Management**: Single source of truth for configuration is critical for maintainability. Multiple configuration variants create confusion and deployment issues.
- **Report Standardization**: Consistent reporting format enables automated processing and better project tracking. Template-based approach improves efficiency.

### Reference Materials
- `/docs/SQLALCHEMY_IMPORT_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete guide to resolving circular imports
- `/docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLIDATION.md` - Strategy for consolidating state management
- `/daily_dev_startup_reports/2025-10-11_tech_debt_sprint.md` - Detailed sprint report

---

## Session Retrospective

### What Went Well
- Successfully resolved critical SQLAlchemy import issues without breaking existing functionality
- Streamlined configuration management by removing redundant enhanced configs
- Improved documentation with 11 new reference documents
- All tests passing after major refactoring (100% success rate)
