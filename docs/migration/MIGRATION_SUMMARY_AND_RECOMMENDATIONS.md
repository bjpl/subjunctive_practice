## Technical Architecture Decisions

### ADR Summary
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **FastAPI Backend** | Preserves Python ecosystem, excellent performance, auto-documentation | Enables code reuse, reduces rewrite risk |
| **React + TypeScript Frontend** | Large ecosystem, accessibility tools, type safety | Modern development experience, maintainable code |
| **Mobile-First Responsive Design** | Growing mobile usage, touch-optimized interface | Better user experience across all devices |
| **Progressive Web App** | Offline capabilities, app-like experience, no app stores | Increased engagement, works everywhere |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first, consistent design, performance | Faster development, smaller CSS bundles |

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Container/Presentation pattern for clear separation
const ExerciseContainer = () => {
  // Business logic and state management
  return <ExercisePresentation {...props} />;
};

// Accessibility-first components
const AccessibleButton = ({ children, ...props }) => (
  <button
    className="focus-visible:ring-2 touch-target-large"
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </button>
);
```

---

## Responsive Design System

### Breakpoint Strategy
- **Mobile (320-767px)**: Single column, bottom navigation, swipe gestures
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: Two-column layout, side navigation drawer
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Multi-column with persistent sidebar

### Typography Scale
- **Spanish-optimized fonts**: Proper diacritic support, legible at all sizes
- **Responsive scaling**: `clamp()` functions for fluid typography
- **Accessibility**: Minimum 18px base font size, 1.6 line height

### Touch Targets
- **WCAG AA compliance**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Enhanced interactions**: Hover states, press animations, gesture support
- **Platform optimization**: Touch-first on mobile, mouse-optimized on desktop

## PWA Capabilities

### Offline-First Architecture
```typescript
// Service Worker caching strategies
const CACHE_STRATEGIES = {
  static: 'cache-first',      // App shell, CSS, JS
  exercises: 'network-first', // Exercise content with fallback
  api: 'stale-while-revalidate', // API responses
  images: 'cache-first'       // Images and assets
};
```

### Key PWA Features
- **500+ cached exercises** for offline practice
- **Background sync** for progress when connection restored
- **Push notifications** for practice reminders and streak milestones
- **Install prompts** after user engagement
- **App shortcuts** for quick access to common features

## Accessibility Excellence

### Multi-Layered Approach
1. **Component Level**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, focus management
2. **Application Level**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements
3. **System Level**: High contrast themes, reduced motion support
4. **Testing Level**: Automated axe-core testing, manual screen reader testing

### Enhanced Features
- **Focus management system** with logical tab order and focus trapping
- **Screen reader announcements** for dynamic content changes
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users (customizable)
- **Multiple themes**: Default, high contrast, dark mode, colorblind-friendly

2. **Import System**: Web app imports and validates data integrity

### Migration Coverage
- **User settings and preferences** → Browser local storage + server sync
- **Progress data and statistics** → PostgreSQL database with full history
- **Exercise history and mistakes** → Review queue for spaced repetition
- **Streaks and achievements** → Gamification system with visual progress

### Compatibility Mode
- Support both legacy and modern data formats during transition
- Automatic data structure upgrades with versioning
- Rollback capabilities if migration issues occur
