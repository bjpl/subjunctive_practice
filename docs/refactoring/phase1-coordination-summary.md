---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 1 Hour)

1. **URGENT:** Execute infrastructure fix plan
   - Follow steps in infrastructure-fix-plan.md
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Verify success criteria met

2. **CRITICAL:** Do NOT spawn agents until infrastructure fixed
   - Agents will fail without working pytest
   - NPM issues will block frontend work
   - Waste time and resources

### Phase 1 Execution (Next 5 Days)

**Day 0 (Today):**
- ✓ Coordination complete (this document)
- ⏳ Execute infrastructure fixes
- ⏳ Verify all tools working

**Day 1-2:**
- Spawn Task 1 Agent (Architecture Documentation)
- Monitor progress
- Review deliverables

**Day 3:**
- Spawn Task 2 Agent (Code Quality Tools)
- Update configurations
- Test CI/CD pipeline

**Day 4:**
- Spawn Task 3 Agent (Baseline Metrics)
- Spawn Task 4 Agent (File Organization)
- Monitor both agents

**Day 5:**
- Validate all deliverables
- Run verification tests
- Generate completion report
- Prepare Phase 2 plan

### Phase 2 Preparation

**After Phase 1 Complete:**
- Review Phase 1 success metrics
- Adjust Phase 2 timeline if needed
- Identify Phase 2 agents required
- Create Phase 2 execution plan
- Get stakeholder approval

## Risk Management

### Risks Identified

**Risk 1: Infrastructure Fixes Fail**
- Probability: LOW (detailed plan provided)
- Impact: HIGH (blocks all work)
- Mitigation: Alternative approaches documented, can skip non-critical tools

**Risk 2: Agent Execution Issues**
- Probability: MEDIUM (new agent spawning)
- Impact: MEDIUM (delays timeline)
- Mitigation: Sequential execution, validation after each agent

**Risk 3: Test Coverage Unknown**
- Probability: CONFIRMED
- Impact: MEDIUM (can't track improvement)
- Mitigation: Establish baseline before changes

**Risk 4: Timeline Slippage**
- Probability: MEDIUM (5-day estimate)
- Impact: LOW (acceptable variance)
- Mitigation: Buffer time in schedule, can parallelize some tasks

### Risk Monitoring

**Daily Checks:**
- Blocker status
- Agent progress
- Test results
- Build health

**Escalation Path:**
- Day 0-1: Coordinator handles
- Day 2+: Escalate to project lead
- Critical issues: Immediate escalation
