---

## üéØ Phase 1: Version Control Setup

### ‚öôÔ∏è MANUAL STEPS (You Do This)

**1.1 Initialize Git Repository**
```bash
cd /path/to/subjunctive_practice
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Spanish Subjunctive Practice App"
```

**1.2 Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `spanish-subjunctive-practice`
3. Make it **Private** (keep code private for now)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have code)
5. Click "Create repository"

**1.3 Push to GitHub**
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spanish-subjunctive-practice.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### ü§ñ CLAUDE CODE CAN HELP

Ask Claude Code to:
- Generate comprehensive `.gitignore` files
- Create semantic commit messages
- Audit code for secrets before commit
- Generate GitHub repository description

**Example prompt:**
```
"Check all files for hardcoded secrets or API keys before I commit"
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Railway)

### ‚öôÔ∏è MANUAL STEPS (You Do This)

**2.1 Sign Up for Railway**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

**2.2 Create New Project**
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose `spanish-subjunctive-practice`
4. Railway will auto-detect it's a Python app

**2.3 Add PostgreSQL Database**
1. In Railway project dashboard, click "+ New"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "Add PostgreSQL"
3. Wait 30 seconds for provisioning
4. Database URL will auto-populate in environment variables

**2.4 Configure Environment Variables**

Click on your backend service ‚Üí "Variables" tab ‚Üí Add these:

```bash
# Core Settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
API_V1_PREFIX=/api

# Database (Railway auto-populates DATABASE_URL)
# Just verify it exists - Railway connects it automatically

# Security (CRITICAL - Generate Secure Values)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<GENERATE_WITH_OPENSSL_BELOW>
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1440
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# CORS (Update after Vercel deployment)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Generate Secure JWT Secret:**
```bash
# Run this in your terminal
openssl rand -hex 32

# Copy the output and paste as JWT_SECRET_KEY value
```

**2.5 Add Railway Configuration**

Railway needs to know how to start your app. It looks for:
- `railway.json` (recommended)
- `Procfile`
- Or auto-detects from `requirements.txt`

### ü§ñ CLAUDE CODE DOES THIS

**Prompt for Claude Code:**
```
"Create Railway deployment configuration for the backend.
Include railway.json with proper start command, health checks,
and environment variable references."
```

Claude Code will create:
- `railway.json` with service configuration
- Updated `requirements.txt` for production
- Health check endpoints verification
- Database migration scripts

**2.6 Deploy Backend**

Railway auto-deploys on git push:

```bash
# Make Railway-generated config changes
git add railway.json backend/
git commit -m "feat: Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

Railway will:
1. Detect the push
2. Build the Docker container
3. Run database migrations
4. Start the FastAPI server
5. Provide a public URL like: `https://spanish-subjunctive-practice-production.up.railway.app`

**2.7 Verify Backend Deployment**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","database_connected":true}
```

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Spanish Subjunctive Practice
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG=false
```

**Option B: Vercel CLI (Faster for Re-deploys)**

```bash
cd frontend
vercel login
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name: spanish-subjunctive-practice
# - Which directory is your app? ./
# - Override settings? No
```

**Add environment variables via CLI:**
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Won't Start on Railway

**Symptom**: Build succeeds but app crashes on start

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --tail 50

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing environment variables
# 2. Database connection failure
# 3. Port binding (Railway sets PORT automatically)
```

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
"Debug Railway deployment logs. The app builds but crashes on start.
Here are the logs: [paste logs]"
```

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Symptom**: CORS errors or 404 on API calls

**Fix:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel environment variables
2. Check backend `CORS_ORIGINS` includes Vercel URL
3. Test backend health endpoint directly

```bash
# Test backend directly
curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health

# Check CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://your-app.vercel.app" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/auth/login
```

### Database Migrations Fail

**Symptom**: Railway logs show migration errors

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
"The database migrations are failing on Railway with this error: [paste error].
Help me create a manual migration script and update the deployment process."
```

### Rate Limiting Too Aggressive

**Symptom**: Legitimate users getting 429 errors

**Fix:**
Update Railway environment variable:
```
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=120  # Increase from 60
```

### JWT Tokens Expiring Too Fast

**Symptom**: Users logged out frequently

**Fix:**
```
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080  # 7 days instead of 24 hours
```
