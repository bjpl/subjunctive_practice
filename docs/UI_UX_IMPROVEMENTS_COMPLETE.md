- **Result**: All text is now clearly readable with proper scaling

#### 2. **Form Input Visibility When Window Expanded** âœ… FIXED  
- **Problem**: Text in form boxes not visible when window is expanded
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive font scaling and proper contrast ratios
- **Result**: Form inputs now scale properly and maintain visibility at all window sizes

#### 3. **Missing Progress Indicators for API Calls** âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: API calls take up to a minute with no visual feedback
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive progress indicators with spinners and overlays
- **Result**: Users now see clear loading feedback during all API operations

#### 4. **Awkward Red Boxes Around Form Selectors** âœ… FIXED
- **Problem**: Harsh red focus indicators around form elements
