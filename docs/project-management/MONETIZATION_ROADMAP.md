## üéØ Phase 1: Pre-Monetization (Week 1-2)

### Objective: Validate product-market fit with free tier

**1.1 User Acquisition (Manual + You)**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Use app yourself daily (eat your own dog food)
- [ ] Invite 10 friends/family to beta test
- [ ] Post on r/Spanish, r/languagelearning (soft launch)
- [ ] Create demo video (1-2 min, show value proposition)
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics or PostHog

**Success Metrics:**
- 25+ registered users
- 10+ daily active users
- 60%+ completion rate (users who finish first exercise)
- Average 5+ exercises per session

**üìã What Claude Code Can Do:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Create an analytics dashboard that shows:
- Daily/weekly/monthly active users
- User retention (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)
- Exercise completion rates
- Popular exercise types
- Average session duration
Save this data to the database for historical tracking."
```

**Prompt:**
```
"Add a 'Share Your Progress' feature that generates:
- A shareable image with user stats (XP, streak, level)
- Social media meta tags for nice previews
- Twitter/Facebook share buttons with pre-filled text
Example: 'I just completed 50 Spanish subjunctive exercises! üéâ'"
```

---

**1.2 Feedback Collection (You + Claude Code)**

**Manual:**
- Send personal email to each beta user after 3 days
- Ask:
  - Would you pay for this? If so, how much?
  - What features are missing?
  - What would make you upgrade to a paid plan?

**üìã Claude Code:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Create in-app feedback system:
- After every 10 exercises, show optional feedback form
- Questions:
  1. How helpful was this session? (1-5 stars)
  2. What would improve your experience?
  3. Would you pay for premium features? (Yes/No/Maybe)
  4. If yes, what's a fair monthly price? ($2.99/$4.99/$9.99)
- Store responses in 'user_feedback' database table
- Create admin dashboard to view aggregated results"
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Price sensitivity (most will say $2.99-$4.99)
- Most-wanted features (likely: unlimited exercises, AI feedback, mobile app)
- Pain points (UI issues, missing exercises, unclear explanations)

---

- Basic feedback (correct/incorrect + explanation)
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Streak counter

**Pro Tier Candidates** ($4.99/mo):
- Unlimited exercises
- AI-powered personalized feedback
- Detailed analytics (weak areas, improvement trends)
- Export progress as PDF

- `frontend/components/upgrade-prompt.tsx`
- `frontend/components/pricing-cards.tsx`

---

### 2.4 Feature Gating Logic (Claude Code - 60 min)

**üìã Prompt for Claude Code:**

```
"Implement tiered feature access:

1. Backend: Create subscription checker middleware
   - Add user.subscription_tier to JWT payload
   - Create @requires_tier('pro') decorator
   - Apply to protected routes:
     - /api/exercises (limit to 10/day for free users)

     - /api/progress/export (only for pro+)

2. Frontend: Create useSubscription hook
   - Access current user's plan from Redux
   - Helper functions:
     - canAccessFeature('unlimited_exercises')
     - getRemainingExercises() (for free tier)
     - shouldShowUpgradePrompt()

3. Database: Track usage
   - Add daily_exercise_count to user_statistics
   - Reset counter at midnight UTC
   - Log each exercise attempt with timestamp

4. Upgrade prompts:
   - Show modal when free user attempts 11th exercise
   - Show badge on AI feedback button if user is free tier
   - Add 'Pro' badges next to premium features in UI
```

---

### 2.5 Testing Payment Flow (Manual + Claude Code)

**Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Test Mode Checkout:**
   ```
   - Click "Upgrade to Pro" on your local app
   - Should redirect to Stripe Checkout
   - Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Any future expiry, any CVV
   - Complete payment
   - Verify redirect back to app
   - Check database: user subscription_tier updated to 'pro'
   ```

2. **Test Webhook:**
   ```bash
   # Install Stripe CLI
   stripe login

   # Forward webhooks to local backend
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/payments/webhook

   # Trigger test events
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted

   # Check backend logs to confirm events received
   ```

3. **Test Feature Access:**
   ```
   - Login with free account
   - Complete 10 exercises
   - Try 11th exercise ‚Üí Should see upgrade prompt
   - Click upgrade, complete payment
   - Try 11th exercise again ‚Üí Should now work
   ```

**üìã Claude Code Can Generate:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Create automated Stripe integration tests:
- Test checkout session creation
- Test webhook signature verification
- Mock Stripe API calls for CI/CD

## üöÄ Phase 3: Soft Launch (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Pre-Launch Checklist (Manual)

**Legal & Compliance:**
- [ ] Terms of Service updated with billing terms
- [ ] Privacy Policy updated (mention Stripe data processing)
- [ ] Refund policy defined (7-day money-back? Pro-rated?)
- [ ] Tax handling (Stripe handles most EU VAT automatically)

**Technical:**
- [ ] Switch Stripe from Test Mode to Live Mode
- [ ] Update environment variables with live keys
- [ ] Test live payment with real $1 transaction
- [ ] Set up billing alert (Stripe dashboard ‚Üí Email notifications)

**Customer Support:**
- [ ] Create support email (support@your-domain.com or Gmail)
- [ ] Write billing FAQ page
- [ ] Create cancel subscription guide
- [ ] Prepare refund process documentation

---

### 3.2 Launch Strategy (You Decide)

**Option A: Free-First (Recommended)**

1. Launch with free tier only
2. Build to 100+ free users
3. Send email: "We're adding Pro features! Founding member discount: 50% off first 3 months"
4. Enable payments
5. Track conversion rate

**Pros:**
- Lower barrier to entry
- Build user base first
- Validate demand before building paid features
- Create urgency with "founding member" discount

**Cons:**
- Delayed revenue
- Some users may leave when paywall added

---

**Option B: Freemium from Day 1**

1. Launch with free + pro tiers immediately
2. Offer lifetime founding member rate ($2.99/mo instead of $4.99)
3. Time-limited offer (first 100 customers)

**Pros:**
- Immediate revenue validation
- Early adopters willing to pay to support you
- Filters out tire-kickers

**Cons:**
- May reduce initial user count
- Requires billing infrastructure to be perfect

---

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**

1. Week 1-2: Free only, collect feedback
2. Week 3: Announce Pro tier coming with founding member discount
3. Week 4: Enable Pro tier with 50% launch discount
4. Week 5-6: Monitor conversion, iterate on messaging

---

### 3.3 Pricing Experiments (A/B Testing)

**Test 1: Price Points**
- Group A: $2.99/mo
- Group B: $4.99/mo
- Group C: $7.99/mo

Track conversion rate for each. Optimal price = highest revenue (conversions √ó price).

**Test 2: Billing Frequency**
- Annual plan: $49/year (save $10 = 2 months free)
- Monthly: $4.99/mo

Many users prefer annual for "set it and forget it."

**üìã Claude Code Can Help:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Add A/B testing infrastructure:
- Randomly assign users to pricing cohorts on signup
- Track cohort in database
- Show different prices on /pricing page based on cohort
- Create admin dashboard to compare conversion rates by cohort
- After 100 signups, determine winning price"
```

---

### 4.2 Retention & Churn Reduction

**Why Users Leave:**
1. Not seeing progress (fix: Better progress visualization)
2. Too hard or too easy (fix: Adaptive difficulty)
3. Forgot about app (fix: Email reminders)
4. Found competitor (fix: Differentiation)

**Retention Tactics:**

**üìã Claude Code:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Implement retention features:

1. Email campaigns (via SendGrid or Mailgun):
   - Day 0: Welcome email with quick start guide
   - Day 3: 'You're on a 3-day streak! Keep going üî•'
   - Day 7: Weekly progress report
   - Day 14: 'What would make this app better?' (feedback request)
   - Day 30: Celebration email + offer to upgrade
   - Churn prevention: If user inactive for 7 days, send 'We miss you' email

2. Gamification enhancements:
   - Achievements/badges (First 10 exercises, 30-day streak, 100% accuracy week, etc.)
   - Leaderboard (optional, anonymous usernames)
   - Daily challenge (harder exercise = bonus XP)

3. Progress visualization:
   - Heatmap calendar (like GitHub contributions)
   - Line chart of accuracy over time
   - 'You're in top 10% of users!' messages
```

**Prompt:**
```
"Create churn prediction model:
- Identify users at risk of churning (e.g., no activity in 3+ days, declining accuracy)
- Mark them in database
- Trigger re-engagement campaign
- A/B test: Discount offer vs. New feature announcement
Track which is more effective at reactivating users."
```

   - One-time purchase: Full exercise pack download ($19.99)
   - Live tutoring session ($29.99/session)
   - Personalized learning plan (AI-generated, $9.99 one-time)

2. **Annual Plans**
   - Offer 2 months free for annual commitment
   - $49/year vs. $59.88/year if paid monthly

3. **Team/Family Plans**
   - $14.99/mo for up to 5 users (teachers, families)
   - Separate dashboard for teacher to track students

**üìã Claude Code:**

**Prompt:**
```
"Implement family/team subscriptions:
- Create 'team' plan tier
- Allow primary user to invite up to 5 members
- Members get full pro access
- Primary user sees dashboard with all members' progress
- Billing: Only primary user pays, others get free access
- Add team management UI: invite via email, remove members"
```

## üöß Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Pricing Too Low

**Mistake**: Charging $0.99/mo because you're scared no one will pay

**Reality**:
- $0.99/mo = $11.88/year
- After Stripe fees, you get ~$10/year per user
- Need 100 paying users just to make $1,000/year
- Your time is worth more

**Solution**: Price at $4.99/mo minimum. Your target users (serious learners) happily pay $10-15/mo for Duolingo, Babbel, etc. You're providing value‚Äîcharge accordingly.

---

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Features Behind Paywall

**Mistake**: Free tier is useless (e.g., only 1 exercise/day)

**Reality**: Users need to experience value before paying

**Solution**:
- Free tier should be genuinely useful (10 exercises/day is plenty to see progress)
- Pro tier is about removing friction (unlimited) and adding bonus features (AI feedback), not making free unusable

---

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Churn

**Mistake**: Focusing only on new customers, not retention

**Reality**:
- If you gain 10 users/month but lose 8, net growth = 2
- Retention is easier than acquisition

**Solution**:
- Track churn weekly
- Interview users who cancel (ask "What would have kept you?")
- Implement win-back campaigns

---

### Pitfall 4: No Customer Support

**Mistake**: Hiding behind automated systems, never talking to users

**Reality**:
- Personal support = your competitive advantage as a solo founder
- Users remember great support and recommend you

**Solution**:
- Reply to every email within 24 hours (automate acknowledgment, but personalize response)
- Jump on a call with churned users (you'll learn more in 10 min than 100 surveys)

---
