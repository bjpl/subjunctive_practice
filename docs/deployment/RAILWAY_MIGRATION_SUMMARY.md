# Railway Migration Summary

**Migration Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Migrated From**: Render
**Migrated To**: Railway

## Migration Overview

Successfully migrated the Spanish Subjunctive Practice backend deployment from Render to Railway platform. All configuration files, documentation, and CI/CD workflows have been updated.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files Created

#### Backend Railway Configuration
- ✅ `backend/railway.toml` - Primary Railway configuration
- ✅ `backend/railway.json` - Alternative JSON format configuration
- ❌ `backend/render.yaml` - REMOVED

**railway.toml Features:**
- Nixpacks builder with pip install
- Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers (4 workers)
- Health check at `/health` endpoint
- Auto-restart on failure (max 10 retries)
- Resource limits: 0.5 CPU, 512Mi memory
- Auto-scaling: 1-10 instances

### 2. Documentation Created

#### Railway Setup Guides
- ✅ `docs/deployment/RAILWAY_SETUP.md` - Complete Railway deployment guide
- ✅ `docs/deployment/RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.md` - Environment variables reference
- ✅ `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Main deployment guide (Railway-focused)
- ✅ `docs/deployment/RAILWAY_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### 3. Configuration Updates

#### Frontend Configuration
- ✅ `frontend/vercel.json` - Updated API rewrite URL
  ```json
  "destination": "https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/:path*"
  ```

#### CI/CD Workflows
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` - Already configured for Railway
- ✅ Uses `RAILWAY_STAGING_TOKEN` and `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_TOKEN`
- ✅ Automatic deployments on push to main
- ✅ Database migrations via `railway run alembic upgrade head`

#### Deployment Scripts
- ✅ `scripts/deploy.sh` - Already using Railway CLI
- ✅ `scripts/db-backup.sh` - Compatible with Railway
- ✅ No changes needed - scripts were Railway-ready

### 4. Environment Configuration

Railway automatically manages these variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (auto-injected by plugin)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection (auto-injected by plugin)
- `PORT` - Application port (auto-set by Railway)

Required manual configuration in Railway dashboard:
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - JWT signing secret
- `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` - Session encryption key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Frontend domain URL

## Before/After Comparison

### Deployment Platform

| Feature | Render (Before) | Railway (After) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Config File** | `render.yaml` | `railway.toml` + `railway.json` |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Render) | PostgreSQL (Railway plugin) |
| **Cache** | Redis (Render) | Redis (Railway plugin) |
| **Deployment** | Git push or Render dashboard | Git push or `railway up` |
| **CLI Tool** | N/A (was planned) | `@railway/cli` |
| **Auto-Deploy** | ✅ On push to main | ✅ On push to main |
| **Env Vars** | Render dashboard | Railway dashboard + CLI |
| **Migrations** | Manual or scripts | `railway run alembic upgrade head` |
| **Logs** | Render dashboard | `railway logs` + dashboard |
| **Rollback** | Render dashboard | `railway rollback` |

### Configuration Differences

#### Database Connection
```diff
# Render
- fromDatabase:
-   name: subjunctive-postgres
-   property: connectionString

# Railway
+ # DATABASE_URL automatically injected by Railway PostgreSQL plugin
```

#### Redis Connection
```diff
# Render
- fromService:
-   name: subjunctive-redis
-   type: redis
-   property: connectionString

# Railway
+ # REDIS_URL automatically injected by Railway Redis plugin
```

#### Health Checks
```diff
# Render
- healthCheckPath: /health
- autoDeploy: true

# Railway
+ [healthcheck]
+ path = "/health"
+ interval = 30
+ timeout = 10
```

## Migration Steps Completed

1. ✅ Analyzed Render configuration (`render.yaml`)
2. ✅ Created Railway configuration files (`railway.toml`, `railway.json`)
3. ✅ Created comprehensive Railway documentation
4. ✅ Updated frontend Vercel configuration with Railway URL pattern
5. ✅ Verified GitHub Actions workflows (already Railway-compatible)
6. ✅ Verified deployment scripts (already Railway-compatible)
7. ✅ Created environment variables reference guide
8. ✅ Removed Render configuration file (`render.yaml`)
9. ✅ Created migration summary (this document)

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Railway Account Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
cd backend
railway init
railway link
```

### 2. Add Database Services (2 minutes)

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL
railway add --plugin postgresql

# Add Redis (optional but recommended)
railway add --plugin redis
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables → Raw Editor

```bash
# Generate secure keys
python -c "import secrets; print('JWT_SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
python -c "import secrets; print('SESSION_SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Set in Railway dashboard:
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generated-value>
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=<generated-value>
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### 4. Deploy Backend (3 minutes)

```bash
# Option A: Git push (auto-deploy)
git push origin main
