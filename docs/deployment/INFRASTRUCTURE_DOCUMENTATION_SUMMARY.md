## Cost Optimization

### Current Monthly Costs (Estimated)

```
Backend (Railway):        $20-50
Database (PostgreSQL):    $10-25
Redis:                    $5-10
Frontend (Vercel):        $0-20
CDN (CloudFlare):         $0-20

------------------------
Total:                    $35-150/month
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Database:** Regular vacuum, archive old data
2. **API:** Implement rate limiting
3. **CDN:** Optimize caching, compress images
4. **Monitoring:** Adjust sampling rates
5. **Scaling:** Right-size instances, use auto-scaling
