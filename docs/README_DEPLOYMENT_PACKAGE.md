## 🆘 Getting Unstuck

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** in `DEPLOYMENT_WALKTHROUGH_COMPLETE.md`
2. **Common issues:**
   - CORS errors → Verify backend CORS_ORIGINS includes frontend URL
   - Database errors → Check Railway logs: `railway logs --tail 50`
   - Build failures → Read Vercel build logs for error messages

3. **Ask Claude Code:**
   ```
   "My deployment is failing with this error: [paste error].
   Here are the relevant logs: [paste logs].
   Help me debug and fix this issue."
   ```

4. **Community support:**
   - Railway Discord: https://discord.gg/railway
   - Vercel Discord: https://discord.gg/vercel
   - Next.js GitHub Discussions

### If monetization isn't working:

1. **Low conversion?**
   - Survey users: "What would make you upgrade?"
   - A/B test pricing ($2.99 vs. $4.99)
   - Improve value proposition on pricing page

2. **High churn?**
   - Interview churned users
   - Implement re-engagement email campaigns
   - Add more value to Pro tier

3. **No signups?**
   - Review acquisition channels (SEO, ads, content)
   - Simplify registration flow
   - Add social proof (testimonials, user count)
