# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
## Spanish Subjunctive Practice MVC Refactoring

### ADR-001: MVC Architecture Pattern Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

#### Context
The Spanish Subjunctive Practice application has grown to a monolithic 4,010-line main.py file that combines UI logic, business logic, data management, and external integrations. This creates maintenance challenges, testing difficulties, and coupling issues.

#### Decision
We will refactor the monolithic application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

#### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC clearly separates data (Model), presentation (View), and application logic (Controller)
- **PyQt Compatibility**: PyQt's signal-slot mechanism aligns well with MVC event handling patterns
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with proper mocking
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one layer don't require modifications to others
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different layers simultaneously

#### Alternatives Considered
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)**: Rejected due to additional complexity for desktop applications
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Rejected due to PyQt's limited data binding compared to web frameworks
- **Component-Based**: Rejected due to the need for clear data flow in educational software

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved maintainability, testability, and team collaboration
- **Negative**: Initial refactoring effort, learning curve for MVC patterns
- **Neutral**: Slight increase in file count, need for dependency injection

### ADR-002: Dependency Injection Container

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
The MVC pattern requires loose coupling between components. The monolithic code has tight dependencies that need to be managed for proper separation of concerns.

#### Decision
Implement a lightweight dependency injection (DI) container for managing component dependencies.

#### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Easy to inject mock objects for unit testing
- **Configuration**: Centralized dependency configuration
- **Lifecycle Management**: Control object creation and lifetime

#### Implementation Details
```python
# Container interface
class DIContainer:
    def register(self, interface, implementation, lifetime='transient')
    def get(self, interface)
    def get_all(self, interface)

# Lifetime options
- transient: New instance every time
- singleton: Single instance throughout application
- scoped: Single instance per scope (e.g., per session)
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Manual Dependency Management**: Rejected due to complexity and tight coupling
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Rejected due to hidden dependencies
- **Factory Pattern**: Rejected due to limited flexibility

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved testability, flexibility, and maintainability
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer, initial setup complexity
- **Neutral**: Need for interface definitions

---

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Communication

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
MVC components need to communicate without creating tight coupling. The existing PyQt signal-slot system provides a foundation for event-driven communication.

#### Decision
Implement an event bus system that extends PyQt's signal-slot mechanism for MVC layer communication.

#### Rationale
- **Decoupling**: Components communicate through events, not direct references
- **PyQt Integration**: Builds on existing signal-slot infrastructure
- **Extensibility**: New components can subscribe to events without modifying existing code
- **Debugging**: Centralized event logging and monitoring

#### Implementation Details
```python
class EventBus(QObject):
    # Model events
    model_changed = pyqtSignal(str, object)  # (model_name, data)
    
    # View events  
    user_action = pyqtSignal(str, object)    # (action_name, data)
    
    # Controller events
    operation_started = pyqtSignal(str)      # (operation_name)
    operation_completed = pyqtSignal(str, object)  # (operation_name, result)
    
    def emit_model_change(self, model_name: str, data: object)
    def emit_user_action(self, action_name: str, data: object)
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, callback: callable)
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Direct Method Calls**: Rejected due to tight coupling
- **Observer Pattern**: Rejected due to complexity compared to signals
- **Message Queues**: Rejected as overkill for desktop application

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Loose coupling, extensibility, maintainability
- **Negative**: Indirect communication can be harder to trace
- **Neutral**: Need for event documentation and naming conventions

### ADR-004: Service Layer for Business Logic

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
Complex business logic (TBLT scenarios, spaced repetition, conjugation rules) is currently mixed with UI and data concerns. This needs to be separated for reusability and testability.

#### Decision
Introduce a Service Layer between Controllers and Models to encapsulate business logic.

#### Rationale
- **Single Responsibility**: Services focus only on business rules and algorithms
- **Reusability**: Business logic can be used by different controllers
- **Testability**: Complex algorithms can be unit tested independently
- **Caching**: Services can implement caching strategies for performance

#### Service Categories
```python
# Educational Services
class TBLTService:          # Task-based learning methodology
class ConjugationService:   # Grammar rules and conjugation patterns
class SpacedRepetitionService: # SRS algorithm implementation

# Data Services  
class AnalyticsService:     # Learning analytics and progress tracking
class ExportService:        # Data export functionality
class ImportService:        # Data import functionality

# Infrastructure Services
class ApiService:           # External API integration
class CacheService:         # Caching strategy
class LoggingService:       # Application logging
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Fat Controllers**: Rejected due to violation of single responsibility
- **Fat Models**: Rejected due to mixing business logic with data concerns
- **Utility Classes**: Rejected due to lack of state management and dependency injection

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation of business logic, improved testability
- **Negative**: Additional layer adds complexity
- **Neutral**: Need for service interfaces and dependency management

### ADR-005: PyQt Compatibility Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
The application needs to support both PyQt5 and PyQt6 for compatibility across different Python environments and operating systems.

#### Decision
Maintain the existing PyQt compatibility layer and enhance it to support the MVC refactoring.

#### Rationale
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support existing PyQt5 installations
- **Future Proofing**: Support migration to PyQt6
- **Abstraction**: Hide PyQt version differences from business logic
- **Testing**: Enable testing across different PyQt versions

#### Implementation Strategy
```python
# Enhanced compatibility layer
class QtCompatibilityLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.qt_version = self.detect_qt_version()
        self.widget_factory = self.create_widget_factory()
    
    def create_widget_factory(self):
        if self.qt_version == 6:
            return PyQt6WidgetFactory()
        else:
            return PyQt5WidgetFactory()

# Abstract widget creation
class WidgetFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_main_window(self) -> QMainWindow
    
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self, text: str) -> QPushButton
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **PyQt6 Only**: Rejected due to compatibility requirements
- **PyQt5 Only**: Rejected due to future deprecation concerns
- **Separate Codebases**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Cross-version compatibility, future flexibility
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction complexity
- **Neutral**: Need for compatibility testing

### ADR-006: Data Persistence Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
The application currently uses JSON files for data persistence. This needs to be maintained while providing flexibility for future database integration.

#### Decision
Implement a Repository Pattern with JSON file backend, designed for easy migration to databases.

#### Rationale
- **Abstraction**: Hide persistence implementation from business logic
- **Migration Path**: Easy transition to SQLite or other databases
- **Testing**: Enable in-memory repositories for unit testing
- **Consistency**: Standardized data access patterns

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Repository interfaces
class UserRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, user: UserModel) -> str
    
    @abstractmethod
    def load(self, user_id: str) -> UserModel
    
    @abstractmethod
    def find_all(self) -> List[UserModel]

# Current implementation
class JsonUserRepository(UserRepository):
    def __init__(self, data_dir: str):
        self.data_dir = data_dir
    
    def save(self, user: UserModel) -> str:
        # JSON serialization logic
        pass

# Future database implementation
class SqliteUserRepository(UserRepository):
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(connection_string)
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Direct File I/O**: Rejected due to coupling with business logic
- **ORM Framework**: Rejected as overkill for current requirements
- **Database-Only**: Rejected due to deployment complexity

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clean data access, migration flexibility, testability
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer
- **Neutral**: Need for repository implementations

### ADR-007: Error Handling Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team

#### Context
The monolithic code has inconsistent error handling patterns. A systematic approach is needed for the MVC architecture.

#### Decision
Implement a layered error handling strategy with custom exceptions and centralized error management.

#### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Standardized error handling across all components
- **User Experience**: Appropriate error messages for different user contexts
- **Debugging**: Detailed error information for developers
- **Recovery**: Graceful degradation and recovery strategies

#### Exception Hierarchy
```python
class ApplicationException(Exception):
    """Base application exception"""
    def __init__(self, message: str, details: dict = None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.details = details or {}

class ModelException(ApplicationException):
    """Data and business logic errors"""
    pass

class ViewException(ApplicationException):
    """UI-related errors"""
    pass

class ControllerException(ApplicationException):
    """Application logic errors"""
    pass

class ServiceException(ApplicationException):
    """Service layer errors"""
    pass

class ApiException(ServiceException):
    """External API errors"""
    pass
```

#### Error Handling Layers
1. **Model Layer**: Validate data, enforce business rules
2. **View Layer**: Handle UI errors, user input validation
3. **Controller Layer**: Coordinate error responses, user feedback
4. **Service Layer**: Handle business logic errors, external service failures
5. **Application Layer**: Global error handling, logging, crash recovery

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Generic Exceptions**: Rejected due to lack of context
- **Return Codes**: Rejected due to error-prone manual checking
- **Global Exception Handler**: Rejected due to loss of context

#### Consequences

#### Decision
Implement a hierarchical configuration system with environment-specific settings and validation.

#### Rationale
- **Centralization**: All configuration in one place
- **Environment Support**: Development, testing, production configurations
- **Validation**: Ensure configuration correctness at startup
- **Security**: Separate secrets from code

#### Configuration Structure
```python
# Configuration hierarchy
config/
├── base_config.py      # Common settings
├── dev_config.py       # Development overrides
├── test_config.py      # Testing overrides
├── prod_config.py      # Production overrides
└── secrets.py          # Secret management

class AppConfig:
    # Application settings
    APP_NAME = "Spanish Subjunctive Practice"
    VERSION = "2.0.0"
    
    # UI settings
    DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE = (1200, 800)
    MIN_WINDOW_SIZE = (1000, 600)
    
    # API settings
    OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4"
    API_TIMEOUT = 30
    MAX_RETRIES = 3
    
    # Data settings
    DATA_DIR = "user_data"
    SESSION_BACKUP_INTERVAL = 300  # seconds
    
    # Feature flags
    ENABLE_ACCESSIBILITY = True
    ENABLE_ANALYTICS = True
    ENABLE_OFFLINE_MODE = False
```

#### Environment Loading
```python
class ConfigLoader:
    def load_config(self, environment: str = None):
        base_config = self.load_base_config()
        env_config = self.load_environment_config(environment)
        secrets = self.load_secrets()
        
        return self.merge_configurations(base_config, env_config, secrets)
```

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Environment Variables Only**: Rejected due to type safety concerns
- **INI Files**: Rejected due to limited structure support
- **YAML Configuration**: Rejected due to additional dependency

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Centralized configuration, environment flexibility
- **Negative**: Initial setup complexity
- **Neutral**: Need for configuration validation

    def exercises(self):
        if not self._exercises_loaded:
            self._load_exercises()
        return self._exercises

# Caching for computed values
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_conjugation_pattern(verb: str, tense: str):
    return compute_conjugation_pattern(verb, tense)
```

**View Layer**:
```python
# Virtual scrolling for large lists
class VirtualizedList(QListView):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setUniformItemSizes(True)  # Performance optimization

# Deferred rendering for complex widgets
class DeferredWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.render_timer = QTimer()
        self.render_timer.timeout.connect(self.render_content)
```

**Controller Layer**:
```python
# Asynchronous operations
class AsyncController(BaseController):
    def perform_long_operation(self, callback):
        worker = QRunnable(lambda: self.long_operation())
        worker.signals.finished.connect(callback)
        QThreadPool.globalInstance().start(worker)

# Operation batching
class BatchProcessor:
    def __init__(self, batch_size=10, delay=100):
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.delay = delay
        self.pending_operations = []
```

**Service Layer**:
```python
# Connection pooling for API calls
class ApiService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pool = HTTPConnectionPool(maxsize=5)

# Data compression for large payloads
class DataService:
    def compress_session_data(self, data):
        return gzip.compress(json.dumps(data).encode())
```

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: Response times, memory usage, API call latency
