# Web Implementation Coordination Status

## Mission: Spanish Subjunctive Practice - Web Migration
**Coordinator:** Web Implementation Coordinator
**Timeline:** 4-week implementation 
**Start Date:** September 1, 2025
**Target Completion:** September 29, 2025

## Current Status: Week 1 - Foundation Setup

### Architecture Analysis Complete âœ…
- **PyQt Application**: 46,000+ line main.py with comprehensive Spanish learning features
- **Web Foundation**: Next.js/React TypeScript setup with accessibility-first components
- **Technology Stack Validated**: FastAPI backend + React frontend recommended
- **Migration Strategy**: Preserve all Spanish learning functionality in web format

### Existing Web Assets Identified âœ…
- Modern React components with accessibility compliance
- TypeScript type definitions for exercises and progress
- Tailwind CSS styling system 
- PWA configuration for offline support
- Test setup with Jest and Playwright

### Coordination Status by Area

#### Backend Development (FastAPI) - ðŸŸ¡ READY TO START
- [ ] FastAPI project structure and core models
- [ ] Spanish learning algorithms API endpoints  
- [ ] Session management and user progress tracking
- [ ] Authentication and security implementation

#### Frontend Development (React) - ðŸŸ¢ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Component architecture established
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [x] Accessibility features implemented
- [ ] Exercise workflow integration
- [ ] Progress tracking dashboard
- [ ] Settings and preferences UI

#### Spanish Learning Features - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PATH
- [ ] TBLT Task Generator web API
- [ ] Conjugation reference system
- [ ] Spaced repetition tracker
- [ ] Adaptive difficulty algorithms
- [ ] Error analysis and feedback

#### Accessibility & Performance - ðŸŸ¡ ONGOING
- [x] WCAG 2.1 AA baseline components
- [ ] Screen reader optimization
- [ ] Keyboard navigation testing  
- [ ] Performance benchmark establishment
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validation

### Resource Allocation Status
- **Backend Specialists**: Ready for FastAPI architecture design
- **Frontend Specialists**: Component integration and workflow development
- **Spanish Learning Specialists**: Algorithm migration and API design  
- **Accessibility Specialists**: Compliance validation and testing
- **Performance Specialists**: Optimization and PWA implementation

### Risk Assessment
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: Feature parity with 46k line PyQt application
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Timeline pressure for 4-week delivery
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Technology stack compatibility (proven web foundation)

### Next Actions (Week 1, Days 2-7)
1. **Backend Architecture**: Deploy FastAPI specialists for core API design
2. **Learning Engine Migration**: Extract and web-adapt Spanish learning algorithms
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect React components to backend APIs
4. **Testing Framework**: Establish comprehensive test suite for web functionality

### Success Metrics Tracking
- **Feature Parity**: Target 100% Spanish learning functionality preserved
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained  
- **Performance**: <2s page load, <3s interactive time
- **Timeline**: 4-week delivery with weekly milestone validation
