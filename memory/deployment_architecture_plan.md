### Architecture Overview

#### 1. Dual-Platform Architecture
```
Subjunctive Practice Application
├── Desktop Platform (PyQt5/6)
│   ├── PyQt Compatibility Layer
│   ├── Native GUI Components
│   ├── Local Data Storage
│   └── Executable Distribution
└── Web Platform (Next.js + FastAPI)
    ├── React Frontend Components
    ├── FastAPI Backend API
    ├── JavaScript Core Logic
    └── Cloud Deployment
```

#### 2. Core Components

**Platform Abstraction Layer** (`src/platform_abstraction.py`):
- Unified interface for both desktop and web platforms
- Automatic platform detection
- Consistent API across implementations
- Seamless user experience switching

**Core Logic Bridge** (`src/core_bridge.py`):
- Bridges Python and JavaScript implementations
- Unified access to core functionality
- Consistency validation between platforms
- Fallback mechanisms

**PyQt Compatibility** (`src/pyqt_compatibility.py`):
- Fixed PyQt6/PyQt5 compatibility issues
- Resolved `AttributeError: AA_EnableHighDpiScaling` 
- Enhanced signal/slot handling
- Deprecation warning suppression

#### 3. Deployment Infrastructure

**Build Scripts**:
- `scripts/build_desktop.py`: Desktop application builder with cx_Freeze
- `scripts/build_web.py`: Web application builder with Next.js/FastAPI
- `scripts/deploy.py`: Master deployment orchestrator

**Health Monitoring** (`scripts/health_monitor.py`):

- System resource monitoring
- Automated issue detection
- Comprehensive reporting

**Architecture Resolver** (`scripts/architecture_resolver.py`):
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Dependency analysis
- Configuration validation
- Automated fixes

### Resolved Conflicts

#### 1. PyQt6/PyQt5 Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: `AttributeError: AA_EnableHighDpiScaling` in PyQt6
**Solution**: Updated compatibility layer to handle PyQt6's automatic high DPI scaling
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### 2. Mixed UI Framework Dependencies
**Problem**: Files importing both PyQt and web frameworks
**Solution**: Platform abstraction layer with automatic detection
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### 3. Build Output Conflicts
**Problem**: Desktop and web builds using same output directory
**Solution**: Separated build outputs to `dist/desktop/` and `dist/web/`
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Deployment Strategy

#### Desktop Deployment
1. **Environment**: Windows/Linux/macOS
2. **Technology**: PyQt5/6 with cx_Freeze
3. **Distribution**: Standalone executable
4. **Build Output**: `dist/desktop/SubjunctivePractice.exe`
5. **Dependencies**: Bundled in executable

#### Web Deployment
1. **Frontend**: Next.js with React components
2. **Backend**: FastAPI with Python core logic
3. **Distribution**: Docker containers or static hosting
4. **Build Output**: `dist/web/` + `scripts/api_server.py`
5. **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or custom servers

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deployment.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, manual dispatch
- **Jobs**: 
  - Architecture analysis and conflict resolution
  - Parallel desktop (Windows) and web (Ubuntu) builds
  - Artifact uploads and deployment validation
- **Artifacts**: Packaged builds ready for distribution

#### Build Process
1. **Pre-build**: Architecture resolution and health checks
2. **Build**: Platform-specific compilation and packaging  
3. **Post-build**: Validation tests and health verification
4. **Package**: ZIP archives with all dependencies
5. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to configured platforms

### Health Monitoring System

#### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Desktop Platform Checks**:
  - Executable existence and integrity
  - PyQt compatibility validation
  - Core module dependencies
  - System resource usage

- **Web Platform Checks**:
  - API endpoint health (`/health`)
  - Frontend build integrity  
  - Node.js environment validation
  - Service connectivity

- **System Resource Monitoring**:
  - CPU usage tracking
  - Memory utilization
  - Disk space monitoring
  - Performance bottleneck detection

#### Monitoring Modes
- **One-time**: Single comprehensive health check
- **Continuous**: Automated monitoring with configurable intervals
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated checks during deployment pipeline

### Configuration Management

#### Deployment Configuration (`config/deployment_config.json`)
```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "platforms": {
      "desktop": {
        "framework": "PyQt",
        "versions_supported": ["PyQt5", "PyQt6"],
